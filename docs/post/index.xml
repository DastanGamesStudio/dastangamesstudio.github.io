      <description>The Light Inside Us&amp;rsquo; lead protagonist is made up of the Children of Light. A collection of many smaller particles that you must guide through a stylistically rendered isometric world.
Within this world, players must then defend themselves against wave upon wave of enemies, doing so by using the particles themselves as weapons.
For each shot taken you&amp;rsquo;ll lose a part of your life, but equally for every enemy you defeat youâ€™ll grow ever stronger.</description>
