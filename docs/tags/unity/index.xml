      <description>We are going to make a small series of assets about one of the most common enemies in all dungeons: the skeletons.
Cursed creatures that seem to be just a bunch of bones, but thanks to the black magic of their master, they come back to life.
The first of the series is the most basic of all. We continue with the cartoon style of our 3D artist Dhiraj Atwal.</description>

      <description>Our first asset for the Unity store and the first work with us of our new graphic designer Dhiraj Atwal.
The pack consists of four Ents. The Ents are a race of sapient tree-like creatures in the J.R.R Tolkien&amp;rsquo;s Lord of the Rings series. They usually have a menacing look, but Dhiraj wanted to give them a more cartoonish look.
In total we have 4 skins that fit each season of the year.</description>
