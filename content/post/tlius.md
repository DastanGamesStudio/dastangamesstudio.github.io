title: "The Light Inside Us"
---

The Light Inside Us' lead protagonist is made up of the Children of Light. A collection of many smaller particles that you must guide through a stylistically rendered isometric world.

Within this world, players must then defend themselves against wave upon wave of enemies, doing so by using the particles themselves as weapons.

For each shot taken you'll lose a part of your life, but equally for every enemy you defeat youâ€™ll grow ever stronger.

It's a unique mechanic, and one that ensures that players are kept on their toes for the entirety of game. It's also something that makes for a very dangerous, yet thrilling, tactical puzzle-esque shooter.

This is also where the game's strategic and puzzle elements come into play, something that only continues grow throughout the game, thanks to all of the different power-ups, weapons, obstacles and even enemies, that are introduced over the course of the game's 55 levels.
