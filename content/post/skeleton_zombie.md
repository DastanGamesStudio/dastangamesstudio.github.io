We are going to make a small series of assets about one of the most common enemies in all dungeons: the skeletons.

Cursed creatures that seem to be just a bunch of bones, but thanks to the black magic of their master, they come back to life.

The first of the series is the most basic of all. We continue with the cartoon style of our 3D artist Dhiraj Atwal.
