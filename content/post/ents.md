Our first asset for the Unity store and the first work with us of our new graphic designer Dhiraj Atwal.

The pack consists of four Ents. The Ents are a race of sapient tree-like creatures in the J.R.R Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series.
They usually have a menacing look, but Dhiraj wanted to give them a more cartoonish look.
